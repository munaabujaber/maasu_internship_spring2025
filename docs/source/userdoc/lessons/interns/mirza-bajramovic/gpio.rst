**Summary**


This lesson covered the basics of GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) and how it is used in STM32 microcontrollers.  
It went through the purpose of GPIO and explained how each pin can be set as input, output, analog, or alternate function.  

The lesson included an overview of important registers like MODER, PUPDR, OTYPER, OSPEEDR, AFR, IDR, ODR, and BSRR, explaining how each one is used to control different aspects of pin behavior.  
It also introduced the idea of GPIO pin modes and described how they work in different configurations like input with pull-up or pull-down, output with push-pull or open-drain, analog input, and alternate function for communication peripherals.  

Overall, it helped make sense of how GPIO works and how to start using it in simple embedded projects.

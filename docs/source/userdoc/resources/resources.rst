   Comprehensive data sheet for the STM32F411CE microcontroller series, detailing specifications, pin configurations, and electrical characteristics.

- `STM32F411xCE Reference Manual <https://www.st.com/resource/en/reference_manual/rm0383-stm32f411xce-advanced-armbased-32bit-mcus-stmicroelectronics.pdf>`__  
   Detailed reference manual for STM32F411 series, covering all peripherals, clock setup, memory organization, and interrupt handling.

**Programming and Development Resources**
-----------------------------------------

- `GNU Linker Documentation <https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~main/cs1300/doc/gnu/ld_3.html>`__  
   Official documentation for the GNU linker, essential for understanding the linker script setup and memory layout configurations in embedded development.

- `DeepBlue Embedded STM32 Programming Tutorials <https://deepbluembedded.com/stm32-arm-programming-tutorials/#stm32-tutorials>`__  
   A collection of tutorials covering the fundamentals of STM32 programming, providing examples and walkthroughs for peripherals, clock configurations, and more.

- `Klein Embedded â€“ STM32 without CubeIDE (Part 1) <https://kleinembedded.com/stm32-without-cubeide-part-1-the-bare-necessities/>`__  
   A guide to working with STM32 microcontrollers outside the CubeIDE environment, focusing on setup and low-level programming essentials.

**Research and Learning Resources**
------------------------------------

- `Wokwi Simulator <https://wokwi.com/>`__
   Currently, Wokwi does not support the STM32F411, but it does support the STM32F103. You can experiment with this and other microcontrollers like Arduino and ESP32.

- `Renode Framework <https://renode.io/>`__
   An open-source framework for simulating embedded systems, allowing you to test and debug code without needing physical hardware.

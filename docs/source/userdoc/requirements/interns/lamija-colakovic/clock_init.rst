   :verification-and-validation: Code review of FLASH_ACR settings, system runs stable at target frequency

   The system must configure the number of flash memory wait states based on the system clock frequency.


.. req:: FLASH_ACR register

   :verification-and-validation: 

   The system must set 3 wait states in the FLASH_ACR register when operating at clock frequencies between 90â€“100 MHz.


.. req:: PLL Configuration Register

   :verification-and-validation: 

   The system shall use the RCC_PLLCFGR_PLLM bit mask to read or write the PLLM field in the RCC_PLLCFGR register, which defines the input division factor for the PLL.


.. req:: RCC_PLLCFGR_PLLM_Pos definition

   The system shall shift the PLLM configuration value by RCC_PLLCFGR_PLLM_Pos bits to align it with its field position in the RCC_PLLCFGR register.

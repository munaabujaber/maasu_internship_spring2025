- **HSI** (High-Speed Internal): Internal RC oscillator, 16 MHz
- **HSE** (High-Speed External): External crystal oscillator, 4â€“26 MHz
- **LSI** (Low-Speed Internal): Internal 32 kHz RC oscillator

   description: **PLL** (Phase-Locked Loop) is a system that increases the frequency of the input clock signal.  
   **PLLCFGR** (PLL Configuration Register) configures the PLL by adjusting dividers and multipliers. A typical frequency of the output clock signal is 100 MHz.  
   **VCO** (Voltage-Controlled Oscillator) is part of the PLL system.  
   **PLLM** is the main divider of the input clock.  
   **PLLN** is the multiplier for the VCO output.  
   **PLLP** is the divider for the PLL output.  
   **PLLQ** and **PLLI2S** are dividers used for USB and I2S configurations, respectively.
